# CRM

This customer relationship manager (CRM) application is built using .NET Core 3.0 MVC framework with Visual Studio Code.

The CRM application, in its current iteration, performs two basic CRUD operations: one for managing a list of custmers/clients/companies (e.g. both potential and current clients of a given business), and one for tasks related to said clients, which most commonly take the form of marketing campaigns to potential clients or management of existing accounts.

Authentication and authorization are implemented with Microsoft Identity, and all database functionality is implemented via MySQL.

Due to file size constraints, only the Models, Views, Controllers, and Data folders have been uploaded. If there is a way to upload all 111MB (300+ files) to Github in one go, feel free to comment.
