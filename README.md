CRM

This customer relationship manager (CRM) application is built using .NET Core 3.0 MVC framework with Visual Studio Code.

The CRM application, in its current iteration, performs two basic CRUD operations: one for managing a list of custmers/clients/companies (e.g. both potential and current clients of a given business), and one for tasks related to said clients, which most commonly take the form of marketing campaigns to potential clients or management of existing accounts.

Authentication and authorization are implemented with Microsoft Identity, and all database functionality is implemented via MySQL.

As this app is in its final stages of development, it's still locally hosted, but will soon be hosted on Azure.
